# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Task:

Build a ReactJS project with Redux and Redux-Persist.
Fetch a feed from this URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos.
Visualize a selector for albums (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...).
Upon selecting an album, visualize "cards" with the image from each element of the JSON and the title of the image beneath it.
Add an option for favoriting images - the user should be able to mark images as favorites. This information should be stored in the Redux state. Favorites should be like an album where all added images can be viewed.
After a page refresh, the state should be restored, and the saved images in Favorites should be visible again.
